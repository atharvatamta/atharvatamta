## ⚡ Hey, I’m Atharva

I build things, break them, fix them, and ship again.
I work across the stack with a strong focus on **modern frontend**, **scalable backends**, and **high performance web apps**.  
I like clean abstractions, fast feedback loops, and tools that actually get out of the way.

- JavaScript  
- TypeScript  
- React  
- Next.js

## 🧩 What I’m Doing Now
- Working as a **Software Development Associate**
- Building production-grade web applications
- Writing code that scales beyond demos
- Learning by doing, not just reading docs

## 🧪 Currently Experimenting With
- Advanced React and state management patterns  
- Next.js performance and architecture  
- 3D interfaces on the web  
- Better testing and deployment workflows

## 🧑‍💻 Builder Mindset
I care about:
- Shipping over perfection  
- Readable code over clever code  
- Systems that don’t fall apart under load  

If it works, it ships.  
If it breaks, I fix it.
